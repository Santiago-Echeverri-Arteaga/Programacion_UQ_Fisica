      "\n",
      "Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of\n",
      "scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most\n",
      "part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual\n",
      "character of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate\n",
      "ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old\n",
      "notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily\n",
      "unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to\n",
      "acquire.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\n",
      "progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\n",
      "persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of\n",
      "their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\n",
      "traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of\n",
      "sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\n",
      "superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\n",
      "credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a\n",
      "touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a\n",
      "temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the\n",
      "impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition,\n",
      "whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very\n",
      "different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former\n",
      "ages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives\n",
      "of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his\n",
      "history, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and\n",
      "troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large\n",
      "portion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less\n",
      "pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we\n",
      "must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of\n",
      "extended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.\n",
      "Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human\n",
      "experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correct\n",
      "views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great\n",
      "whole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom\n",
      "they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or\n",
      "condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider\n",
      "the general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective\n",
      "probability of its details.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\n",
      "least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere(1) have, perhaps,\n",
      "contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\n",
      "other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three\n",
      "has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us\n",
      "little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\n",
      "follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which\n",
      "critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything\n",
      "else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt\n",
      "and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of\n",
      "Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatis\n",
      "personae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears as\n",
      "the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the\n",
      "writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato _or_ Xenophon,\n",
      "we think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and\n",
      "examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than\n",
      "ignorant.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the\n",
      "personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were\n",
      "too much for our belief. This system--which has often comforted the\n",
      "religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those\n",
      "of the New Testament--has been of incalculable value to the historical\n",
      "theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the existence of\n",
      "Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in\n",
      "that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is\n",
      "inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no\n",
      "two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in\n",
      "the good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has\n",
      "idealized--_Numa Pompilius._\n",
      "\n",
      "Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and\n",
      "the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission\n",
      "to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition,\n",
      "concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few\n",
      "authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the\n",
      "arguments appear to run in a circle. \"This cannot be true, because it is\n",
      "not true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true.\" Such seems to\n",
      "be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement,\n",
      "is consigned to denial and oblivion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\n",
      "partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\n",
      "truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the\n",
      "Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the\n",
      "treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia, was, at an early\n",
      "period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.\n",
      "Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor,\n",
      "he married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis. The\n",
      "girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of\n",
      "Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we \"are\n",
      "indebted for so much happiness.\" Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile\n",
      "frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near\n",
      "the river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis had been transported in\n",
      "order to save her reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At this time,\" continues our narrative, \"there lived at Smyrna a man\n",
      "named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married,\n",
      "engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as\n",
      "the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her performance\n",
      "of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of\n",
      "marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her\n",
      "son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully\n",
      "brought up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\n",
      "had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\n",
      "attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\n",
      "died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed.\n",
      "Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great success,\n",
      "exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of\n",
      "the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the\n",
      "exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these visitors, one\n",
      "Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and\n",
      "intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close\n",
      "his school, and accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to pay\n",
      "his expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that,\n",
      "\"While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own\n",
      "eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his\n",
      "discourses.\" Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron,\n",
      "\"examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and\n",
      "informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met.\" We\n",
      "may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of\n",
      "preservation(2) Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached\n",
      "Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became\n",
      "much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to\n",
      "the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of\n",
      "Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly\n",
      "became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards\n",
      "formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that\n",
      "it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\n",
      "city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\n",
      "applied himself to the study of poetry.(3)\n",
      "\n",
      "But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean\n",
      "plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here\n",
      "his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one\n",
      "Tychias, an armourer. \"And up to my time,\" continued the author, \"the\n",
      "inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation\n",
      "of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar\n",
      "grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived\".(4)\n",
      "\n",
      "But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\n",
      "the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on\n",
      "Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability,\n",
      "been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.(5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the _converzationes_(6) of the old men,\n",
      "and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\n",
      "favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public\n",
      "maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously  renowned. They\n",
      "avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and\n",
      "procured him an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the\n",
      "purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and\n",
      "left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's demand,\n",
      "but one man observed that \"if they were to feed _Homers,_ they would be\n",
      "encumbered with a multitude of useless people.\" \"From this circumstance,\"\n",
      "says the writer, \"Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans\n",
      "call blind men _Homers._\"(7) With a love of economy, which shows how\n",
      "similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the\n",
      "pension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that\n",
      "Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\n",
      "One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\n",
      "Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\n",
      "verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient poetry\n",
      "to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers,\n",
      "neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him. At his\n",
      "departure, Homer is said to have observed: \"O Thestorides, of the many\n",
      "things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible\n",
      "than the human heart.\"(8)\n",
      "\n",
      "Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\n",
      "merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite,\n",
      "acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable\n",
      "livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at once determined\n",
      "him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be setting sail\n",
      "thither, but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia,\n",
      "which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to\n",
      "accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed\n",
      "that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his\n",
      "breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\n",
      "Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached\n",
      "the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will\n",
      "continue in the words of our author. \"Having set out from Pithys, Homer\n",
      "went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The\n",
      "dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the\n",
      "name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his\n",
      "dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or some time he stood wondering\n",
      "how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be\n",
      "his design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and\n",
      "how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he\n",
      "stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his\n",
      "misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to\n",
      "his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup.(9)\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to\n",
      "their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my\n",
      "friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at\n",
      "the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor\n",
      "thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having\n",
      "finished supper, they banqueted(10) afresh on conversation, Homer\n",
      "narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\n",
      "resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\n",
      "Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer\n",
      "at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place\n",
      "near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story\n",
      "respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he\n",
      "said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed\n",
      "and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him.\n",

      "\"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\n",

      "unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century\n",
      "before Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no\n",
      "written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the\n",
      "earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without\n",
      "writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have\n",
      "been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,\n",
      "transmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and\n",
      "convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long\n",

      "improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian\n",
      "hypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writing\n",
      "in Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian aera, are\n",
      "exceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the\n",

      "lyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the\n",

      "famous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the\n",

      "that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon\n",

      "extraordinary memory, (25) is far less astonishing than that of long\n",
      "manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when\n",
      "even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious.\n",
      "Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard\n",
      "was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a\n",
      "manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a\n",
      "disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as\n",
      "well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the\n",
      "blind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as\n",
      "well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer\n",
      "himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have\n",
      "described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he\n",

      "even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt,\n",
      "that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable\n",
      "change. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems\n",

      "in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have\n",
      "been intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not for\n",
      "the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but\n",
      "also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all\n",
      "those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices\n",
      "which were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript\n",
      "could never reproduce. Not for the general public--they were accustomed to\n",
      "receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a\n",
      "solemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad\n",
      "would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class\n",
      "of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\n",
      "experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\n",
      "written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\n",
      "impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\n",
      "seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\n",
      "there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If\n",
      "we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we\n",
      "should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were\n",
      "first committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest\n",
      "probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of\n",
      "the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh\n",
      "century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of\n",

      "supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of\n",
      "Grecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having been\n",
      "introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions\n",
      "having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and\n",
      "real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only\n",
      "known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable,\n",
      "yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking\n",
      "at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\n",
      "poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\n",
      "considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\n",
      "own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies,\n",
      "just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais\n",

      "conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but\n",
      "very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old\n",

      "together many self existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in\n",
      "the two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to\n",
      "an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the\n",
      "interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are\n",
      "pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ,\n",
      "and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in some cases\n",

      "made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the\n",
      "social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published\n",
      "these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now\n",

      "disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\n",
      "deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his whole\n",
      "work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\n",
      "translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which\n",
      "prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments\n",
      "were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that\n",
      "these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions\n",
      "already existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the\n",
      "original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less\n",
      "cultivated than at present. If something like the general sense could be\n",
      "decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of\n",

      "advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at it\n",

      "Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\n",
      "writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with\n",
      "him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences;\n",
      "but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a wonder if he has\n",
      "ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that\n",
      "which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that, in\n",
      "different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of\n",
      "human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can\n",
      "never attain to this. It furnishes art with all her materials, and without\n",
      "it judgment itself can at best but \"steal wisely:\" for art is only like a\n",
      "prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature. Whatever\n",
      "praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single\n",
      "beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most\n",
      "regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more\n",
      "regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in,\n",
      "and is, therefore, more entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why\n",
      "common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to\n",
      "a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves\n",
      "to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art,\n",
      "than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\n",
      "beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\n",
      "number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which\n",
      "contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those\n",
      "who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according\n",
      "to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant\n",
      "it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to\n",

      "It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that\n",
      "unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of\n",
      "a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he\n",
      "writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every\n",
      "thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called, or a battle\n",
      "fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a\n",

      "splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and\n",
      "becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact\n",

      "this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove.\n",
      "Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens\n",
      "all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This\n",

      "distinguishes him from all other authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\n",
      "violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not\n",
      "enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of\n",
      "nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and\n",
      "affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward\n",
      "forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler\n",
      "sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his\n",
      "imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable.\n",
      "That which Aristotle calls \"the soul of poetry,\" was first breathed into\n",
      "it by Homer, I shall begin with considering him in his part, as it is\n",
      "naturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a\n",
      "poem, and as it is taken for fiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\n",
      "marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though\n",
      "they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such\n",
      "as, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner\n",
      "of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, \"The\n",
      "return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy,\" or the like.\n",
      "That of the Iliad is the \"anger of Achilles,\" the most short and single\n",
      "subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a\n",
      "vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number\n",
      "of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be\n",
      "found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and\n",
      "irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and\n",
      "its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of\n",
      "so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as\n",
      "well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both\n",
      "Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his.\n",
      "The other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\n",
      "so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\n",
      "action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is\n",
      "it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\n",
      "invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story.\n",
      "If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their\n",
      "forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil\n",
      "has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys\n",
      "the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the\n",
      "shades, the AEneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If he\n",
      "be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is AEneas by\n",
      "Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the\n",
      "score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just\n",
      "as long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial\n",
      "armour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not\n",
      "only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the\n",
      "way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon,\n",
      "and the taking of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word\n",
      "from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and AEneas are taken from those of\n",
      "Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.\n",

      "To proceed to the allegorical fable--If we reflect upon those innumerable\n",
      "knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is\n",
      "generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and\n",
      "ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! How fertile will\n",
      "that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties of\n",
      "elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms\n",
      "and persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of\n",

      "could dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed\n",
      "them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged\n",
      "his circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the\n",
      "mode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered\n",
      "in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets\n",
      "to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was\n",
      "no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that\n",
      "demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing\n",
      "all those allegorical parts of a poem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the\n",
      "machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\n",
      "deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems the\n",
      "first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a\n",
      "one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those\n",
      "authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\n",
      "constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of\n",
      "it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\n",
      "philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that\n",
      "mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able\n",
      "to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set: every\n",
      "attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various\n",
      "changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of\n",
      "poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\n",
      "author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety,\n",
      "or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has\n",
      "something so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished\n",
      "them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing\n",
      "can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different\n",
      "degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully\n",
      "diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is\n",
      "furious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice,\n",
      "and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of\n",
      "Hector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by\n",
      "love of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and\n",
      "tenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in\n",
      "Sarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing\n",
      "diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the\n",
      "main of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he\n",
      "takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main\n",
      "characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct\n",
      "in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other\n",
      "natural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage;\n",
      "and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference\n",
      "of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\n",
      "upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds.\n",
      "The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner;\n",
      "they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they\n",
      "are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.\n",
      "His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way\n",
      "peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that\n",
      "differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or\n",
      "the rest, In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an\n",
      "air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage\n",
      "courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &c. They have a\n",
      "parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I\n",
      "believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he will\n",
      "pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how\n",
      "infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that of\n",
      "all others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being\n",
      "perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those\n",
      "who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so\n",
      "there is of speeches, than in any other poem. \"Everything in it has\n",
      "manner\" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or\n",
      "spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a\n",
      "number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part is\n",
      "less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of\n",
      "general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any\n",
      "person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no\n",
      "apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied and\n",
      "judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of the author himself\n",
      "when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer, all which are the\n",
      "effects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action\n",
      "described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.\n",

      "presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts.\n",
      "Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally\n",
      "excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence\n",
      "of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity\n",
      "with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has\n",
      "collected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice an\n",
      "excellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts\n",
      "that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble;\n",

      "If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\n",
      "invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\n",
      "comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of\n",
      "art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\n",
      "fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various views\n",
      "presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to\n",
      "perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of\n",
      "things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by\n",
      "any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his\n",
      "battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with\n",
      "so vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another;\n",
      "such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same\n",
      "manner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above\n",
      "the last in greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not\n",
      "near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every\n",
      "one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is\n",
      "evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are\n",

      "which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity.\n",
      "It is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with\n",
      "the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who\n",
      "had found out \"living words;\" there are in him more daring figures and\n",
      "metaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is \"impatient\" to be\n",
      "on the wing, a weapon \"thirsts\" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the\n",
      "like, yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great\n",
      "in proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\n",
      "diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same\n",
      "degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that\n",
      "is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the\n",
      "furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater\n",
      "clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more\n",
      "intense.\n",
      "\n",
      "To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the\n",
      "compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to\n",
      "poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and\n",
      "filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in\n",
      "some measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot\n",
      "but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as\n",
      "he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the\n",
      "persons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector's\n",
      "plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that\n",
      "of Einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not have\n",
      "been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though but\n",
      "of a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\n",
      "action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets\n",
      "is a short description.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\n",
      "share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfied\n",
      "with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but\n",
      "searched through its different dialects with this particular view, to\n",
      "beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater\n",
      "mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the\n",
      "verse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most\n",
      "affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never\n",
      "using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into\n",
      "two syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more\n",
      "spreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Attic\n",
      "contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler AEolic, which often\n",
      "rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety\n",
      "by altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures,\n",
      "instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run\n",
      "along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further\n",
      "representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to\n",
      "what they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony which\n",
      "makes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in\n",
      "the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the\n",
      "tune of his verses, even without understanding them (with the same sort of\n",
      "diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will\n",
      "find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other\n",
      "language of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to\n",
      "be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\n",
      "ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\n",
      "advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\n",
      "cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\n",
      "Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working\n",
      "up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of,\n",
      "and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to a\n",
      "beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so\n",
      "frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is,\n",
      "that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysius\n",
      "of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this\n",
      "kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at present\n",
      "to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make\n",
      "one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the\n",
      "Muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting\n",
      "vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They\n",
      "roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while\n",
      "we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most\n",
      "smooth imaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is\n",
      "his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his\n",
      "work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and\n",
      "copious than any other, his manners more lively and strongly marked, his\n",
      "speeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and\n",
      "sublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his\n",
      "expression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various.\n",
      "I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these\n",
      "heads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd\n",
      "or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an\n",
      "opposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from\n",
      "thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge\n",
      "of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in\n",
      "that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we\n",
      "are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more\n",
      "than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in\n",
      "judgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because\n",
      "Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention,\n",
      "because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors\n",
      "had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have\n",
      "less in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil\n",
      "the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\n",
      "Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\n",
      "leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\n",
      "profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\n",
      "Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river\n",
      "in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their\n",
      "battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer,\n",
      "boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines\n",
      "more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like AEneas,\n",
      "appears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him,\n",
      "and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines,\n",
      "Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus,\n",
      "scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like the same\n",
      "power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for\n",
      "empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\n",
      "naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish\n",
      "exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may\n",
      "sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness;\n",
      "and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great\n",
      "invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view,\n",
      "we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so\n",
      "noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so\n",
      "much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\n",
      "probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\n",
      "gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed\n",
      "what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles\n",
      "in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near\n",
      "extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances.\n",
      "Thus Homer has his \"speaking horses;\" and Virgil his \"myrtles distilling\n",
      "blood;\" where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy\n",
      "intervention of a deity to save the probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought\n",
      "too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen\n",
      "in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single\n",
      "circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into\n",
      "embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not\n",
      "to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the\n",
      "principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the\n",
      "original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The\n",
      "same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons\n",
      "together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many\n",
      "various and correspondent images. The reader will easily extend this\n",
      "observation to more objections of the same kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\n",
      "narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be\n",
      "found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he\n",
      "lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and the\n",
      "vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a word\n",
      "of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by\n",
      "the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to\n",
      "antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,(38) \"that those times and manners\n",
      "are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.\" Who\n",
      "can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those\n",
      "ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of\n",
      "rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but\n",
      "for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword,\n",
      "and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other\n",
      "side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked\n",
      "at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the\n",
      "heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that\n",
      "simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding\n",
      "monarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and\n",
      "princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to\n",
      "reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world;\n",
      "and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in\n",
      "the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with\n",
      "nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost\n",
      "three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\n",
      "themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be\n",
      "found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone\n",
      "their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their\n",
      "dislike, will become a satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the\n",
      "same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the \"far-darting Phoebus,\"\n",
      "the \"blue-eyed Pallas,\" the \"swift-footed Achilles,\" &c., which some have\n",
      "censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those of the gods\n",
      "depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and\n",
      "had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions\n",
      "in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was\n",
      "a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an\n",
      "irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of\n",
      "opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such;\n",
      "for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to\n",
      "add some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents\n",
      "expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander\n",
      "the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c.\n",
      "Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such\n",
      "distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have\n",
      "something parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\n",
      "Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &c.\n",
      "If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the\n",
      "repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world\n",
      "into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and\n",
      "the iron one, of \"heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought\n",
      "at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter\n",
      "in the islands of the blessed.\" Now among the divine honours which were\n",
      "paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be\n",
      "mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be\n",
      "acceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\n",
      "deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\n",
      "course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour\n",
      "to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise\n",
      "the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by\n",
      "the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as\n",
      "heard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever\n",
      "compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him\n",
      "for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when\n",
      "they prefer the fable and moral of the AEneis to those of the Iliad, for\n",
      "the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the AEneis; as that the\n",
      "hero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his\n",
      "country than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what\n",
      "he never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince\n",
      "as AEneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:\n",
      "it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others\n",
      "select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as\n",
      "some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of\n",
      "Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and\n",
      "mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement,\n",
      "oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph\n",
      "in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\n",
      "Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a\n",
      "fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and\n",
      "that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great\n",
      "reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times,\n",
      "and the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this\n",
      "principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the\n",
      "cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the\n",
      "consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or\n",
      "any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual\n",
      "additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who\n",
      "yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must\n",
      "have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in his\n",
      "sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.(39)\n",
      "\n",
      "In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the\n",
      "honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the\n",
      "characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he\n",
      "still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer\n",
      "faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that\n",
      "warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which\n",
      "holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer not\n",
      "only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other\n",
      "arts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded\n",
      "him. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for\n",
      "contraction or regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and\n",
      "if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted\n",
      "everything. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from\n",
      "the most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and\n",
      "produces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure\n",
      "and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults,\n",
      "have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness\n",
      "of nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains\n",
      "to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\n",
      "characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such\n",
      "as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but\n",
      "by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every\n",
      "particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much\n",
      "softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand\n",
      "duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the\n",
      "rest, the diction and versification only are his proper province, since\n",
      "these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\n",
      "our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\n",
      "literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\n",
      "language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a\n",
      "rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less\n",
      "in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern\n",
      "manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a\n",
      "light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost\n",
      "literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are\n",
      "necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the\n",
      "poetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have\n",
      "not been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to\n",
      "the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope\n",
      "of raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that the\n",
      "fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is\n",
      "most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be\n",
      "content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without\n",
      "endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular\n",
      "place. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when\n",
      "poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will\n",
      "but follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty,\n",
      "let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we\n",
      "ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the\n",
      "censure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to\n",
      "have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of\n",
      "his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\n",
      "sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\n",
      "simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\n",
      "sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain\n",
      "signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train,\n",
      "while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and\n",
      "equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner\n",
      "pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such\n",
      "commendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which his\n",
      "friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world\n",
      "will call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well\n",
      "as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air\n",
      "of a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up,\n",
      "and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between\n",
      "ostentation and rusticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\n",
      "Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired\n",
      "writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were\n",
      "intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the\n",
      "world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of\n",
      "course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any\n",
      "other writer. This consideration (together with what has been observed of\n",
      "the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator, on\n",
      "the one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners\n",
      "of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from\n",
      "being used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which\n",
      "have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to\n",
      "mystery and religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\n",
      "should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\n",

      "who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who\n",
      "are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his compound\n",
      "epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done\n",
      "literally into English without destroying the purity of our language. I\n",
      "believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an\n",
      "English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of\n",
      "composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the\n",
      "authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of\n",
      "them; such as \"the cloud-compelling Jove,\" &c. As for the rest, whenever\n",
      "any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a\n",
      "compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or\n",
      "two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet\n",
      "einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated\n",
      "literally \"leaf-shaking,\" but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis:\n",
      "\"the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.\" Others that admit of\n",
      "different significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious\n",
      "variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced. For\n",
      "example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or \"far-shooting,\" is capable\n",
      "of two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the\n",
      "ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the\n",
      "sun; therefore, in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in\n",
      "person, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of\n",
      "the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole,\n",
      "it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same\n",
      "epithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be\n",
      "accommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by\n",
      "no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them,\n",
      "where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they\n",
      "are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show\n",
      "his fancy and his judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole\n",
      "narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\n",
      "hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as\n",
      "neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to\n",
      "offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful\n",
      "in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of\n",
      "insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from\n",
      "higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial\n",
      "of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or\n",
      "the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by the\n",
      "nearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the\n",
      "original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it\n",
      "is a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any:\n",
      "if they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is\n",
      "perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new\n",
      "subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and\n",
      "attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek,\n",
      "and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by\n",
      "chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however,\n",
      "it may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so\n",
      "manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have\n",
      "the ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see I have\n",
      "endeavoured at this beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice\n",
      "to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain\n",
      "without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any\n",
      "entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman,\n",
      "Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable\n",
      "length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase\n",
      "more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four\n",
      "or six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey,\n",
      "ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken\n",
      "in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he\n",
      "did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.\n",
      "He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out\n",
      "of his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of\n",
      "the mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to\n",
      "strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in\n",
      "fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as\n",
      "in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man\n",
      "may account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface\n",
      "and remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in\n",
      "poetry. His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than\n",
      "fifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But\n",
      "that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\n",
      "his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which\n",
      "is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ\n",
      "before he arrived at years of discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for\n",
      "particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits\n",
      "the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt\n",
      "not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which\n",
      "proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the\n",
      "contractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and\n",
      "sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of\n",
      "his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as\n",
      "well as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to\n",

      "sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of\n",
      "the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard\n",
      "to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed\n",
      "him in passages where he wanders from the original. However, had he\n",
      "translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him\n",
      "than Virgil: his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is\n",
      "the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language. But the\n",
      "fate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are\n",

      "\n",
      "That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who\n",
      "translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire\n",
      "which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can\n",
      "bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most\n",
      "agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his\n",
      "style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the\n",
      "more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more\n",
      "sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness\n",
      "and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect\n",
      "even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very\n",
      "cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of\n",
      "antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass\n",
      "than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved\n",
      "either the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him is, to\n",
      "study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how\n",
      "learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the\n",
      "world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\n",
      "ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\n",

      "he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only\n",
      "who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfy\n",
      "such a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere\n",

      "The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Minerva\n",
      "is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend from\n",
      "Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put off the general\n",
      "engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a\n",
      "single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is\n",
      "cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted\n",
      "by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery\n",
      "of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to\n",
      "restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to\n",
      "demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to\n",
      "by Agamemnon. When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the\n",
      "advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp,\n",
      "flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune\n",
      "testifies his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from\n",
      "Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens\n",
      "the Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the\n",
      "next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of\n",

      "learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes this\n",
      "hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In\n",
      "their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design\n",
